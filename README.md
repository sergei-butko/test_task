# Description
Test task "Lucky Ticket" for the first stage of selection for the internship on .NET in AltexSoft.

Console application determines if the ticket number entered by the user is lucky. 
The ticket number is a number that can be 4 to 8 digits long. 
A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of its first half is equal to the sum of the second half. 
If the user entered a number that contains an odd number of digits, then 0 must be added at the beginning of the ticket number. 
After displaying the result on the screen, the program should wait for the repeated input of the next ticket number from the user.
